# bitrieve
Bitrieve is a data undelete module for Ubuntu, designed to recover permanently deleted files on Ext4 file systems before they are overwritten. It enhances recovery accuracy by targeting Ext4-specific metadata structures. Additionally, it allows users to securely erase files by overwriting them with random values.
